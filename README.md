## mona-vtk examples

This repo shows how to implement the MonaController and use it for Paraview Catalyst to do the in-situ data analytics. The `src` folder contains the implementation details of the MonaController based on the MonaCommunicator which is implemented based on [mochi-mona](https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-mona).

There are several examples in the `example` folder:

- basic: This example shows that how the MonaController can be used to execute the basic vtk parallel operations such as send and recv vtk object.


- icetExample: This exmaple shows that how the mochi-mona can be used to execute the iceT test cases based on the iceT wrapper for the mochi-mona.


- MandelbulbCatalystExample: This example shows how the MonaController can be used to execute the tightly coupled in-situ analytics in distributed way.


- MandelbulbColza: This example shows how the MonaController can be used to execute the loosely coupled in-situ analytics in distributed way, the [mochi-colza](https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-colza) is used as the data staging service for this example.


- GrayScottColza: This example is similar with the MandelbulbColza case but the simulation data generated by Gray-Scott simulation.

## Installing

We assume there is a new account on cori system, and we need following operations to install necessary depedencies

**config the spack env**

There are two ways to use the spack, the first one is to init the package.yaml file and the second one is to use the spack env.

For example, we use `spack arch -p` to check the current architecture. If the architecture is the cray, the `package.yaml` should locate at the `~/.spack/cray/`. And we update the `package.yaml` file as needed to install the mochi-software stacks. The sample `package.yaml` is located in `./config/cori/packages.yaml`.

the repo of the spack used by the mochi project: https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/sds/sds-repo.git, and we need to add this repo into the spack system by executing `spack repo add sds-repo` at the current direactlry.

**build ParaView patch**

The source code of ParaView patch is located at this folder: https://gitlab.kitware.com/mdorier/paraview/-/tree/dev-icet-integration, it needs the osmesa to support the rendering capability. We use the osmesa installed by the spack of the cori system:

```
module load spack
spack load -r mesa/qozjngg
PATH="/global/common/cori/software/altd/2.0/bin:$PATH"
```

We also need set the compiler on the cori

```
# for compiling vtk on cori
export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic

# let cc and CC to be the gnu compier
module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu

module swap gcc/8.3.0 gcc/9.3.0
```

At the build direactory of the ParaView, we use cmake commands as follows (if we assume the source direactory is `~/cworkspace/src/ParaView_matthieu/paraview`):

```
cmake ~/cworkspace/src/ParaView_matthieu/paraview -DPARAVIEW_USE_QT=OFF -DPARAVIEW_USE_PYTHON=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA:BOOL=TRUE -DVTK_USE_X:BOOL=FALSE -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc -DVTK_PYTHON_OPTIONAL_LINK=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

**build and install Colza**

```
spack install mochi-colza@main+drc+examples
```
This command will install the necessary mochi softwares

**build all examples**

We can load these depedencies if all depedencies are installed successfully. The sample commands are located in `config/cori/monavtkEnv.sh`. We execute these commands before building the mona-vtk examples. 


Then we can build the mona-vtk the cmake command like this:

```
cmake ~/cworkspace/src/mona-vtk/ -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc -DVTK_DIR=$SCRATCH/build_paraview_matthieu_release/ -DENABLE_EXAMPLE=ON -DParaView_DIR=$SCRATCH/build_paraview_matthieu_release/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON 
```

## Scale evaluation

The scripts of scale examples are located at the `example/MandelbulbColza/testScripts` and `./example/GrayScottColza/testScripts` separately.

For example, we can set the build and src dir properly at the beginning of the scripts, such as

```
export BUILDDIR=/global/cscratch1/sd/zw241/build_monavtk
export SRCDIR=/global/homes/z/zw241/cworkspace/src/mona-vtk
``` 
 
and then execute:

```
sbatch ~/cworkspace/src/mona-vtk/example/MandelbulbColza/testScripts/strongscale/cori_strongscale_mona_4.scripts
```
or

```
sbatch ~/cworkspace/src/mona-vtk/example/GrayScottColza/testScripts/strongscale/cori_gsstrongscale_mona_128_512.scripts
```

### Other potential issues

We could also try to install osmesa by spack manaully:

```
spack install mesa+osmesa~llvm swr=none
```

**Other potential issues**

```

some osmesa warning from paraview if it is built in the Debug mode for building paraview (it is ok when we use the Release mode to build the paraview)

(  44.958s) [pvbatch.3       ]vtkOpenGLFramebufferObj:356    ERR| vtkOpenGLFramebufferObject (0x10005dc58e0): failed at glGenFramebuffers 1 OpenGL errors detected

Try to build the paraview with the Release mode, otherwise, there are mosa related issues

For the python on cori, refer to this (https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/nersc-python/)
If you only use the module option, but the python is not the default one, there are some issues
One issue is "unnamed python module encoding", or other issues that have different gcc version which may cause the byte code issue
It is prefered to use the conda activate than the python virtual env
